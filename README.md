#### milestone_2.py

#### milestone_3.py
Infinite loops over your guess input to check if it is correct

#### milestone_4.py
Creates a hangman class that generates a random choice from a list of words, and gives the player a chance to guess the word with while keeping track of every guess they've attempted

#### milestone_5.py
Expands on milestone_4.py, but adds an extra function outside the class that checks if the player has a valid number of lives left, has lost by taking up all the guess chances or won by getting all the characters right
